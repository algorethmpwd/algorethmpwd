  ### *"I don't break into systems... I just find the doors they left open."*

## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

Just your friendly neighborhood bug hunter still learning the ropes. By day, I'm studying the art of cybersecurity. By night, I'm hunting for vulnerabilities that others missed. I created **Greaper** (because even the digital realm needs its own Grim Reaper), and I'm on a journey to become not just a great hacker, but someone who can teach others how to think like one.

> Sometimes I tell people I'm a "security consultant" because saying "I legally hack into systems" makes people slowly back away at parties.

## 🔧 My Arsenal

```python
tools = {
    "OS": "Kali Linux (because I'm too cool for Windows and too impatient for Arch)",
    "Languages": ["Python 🐍", "Bash 💥", "The language of broken firewalls"],
    "Daily_drivers": ["Burp Suite", "Metasploit", "Coffee.exe", "Patience.py"],
    "Status": "Learning how to explain to my mom what I actually do for a living"
}
```

## 🏆 Achievements

- Created Greaper (more details coming soon)
- When I found my first XSS vulnerability (Mom wasn't impressed but I was thrilled)
- Successfully explained to a non-tech friend what a "bug bounty" is without making their eyes glaze over
- Reached level 99 in overthinking simple problems

## 💭 Daily Thought

> "The best hackers aren't the ones who know all the answers - they're the ones who know how to ask all the right questions."
